# Post-MVP Features

## Planned

- [ ] Azure TTS API integration with API key support
- [ ] Download and use other open source TTS models
- [ ] Audio file cleanup and memory management (ensure temp WAV files are deleted, prevent memory growth)
- [ ] Research performance profiling tools for Swift/macOS apps (Instruments, Memory Graph, etc.)
- [ ] Add error telemetry for crash reporting and diagnostics
- [ ] Design polished app icon
- [ ] Adopt Apple Liquid Glass design language
- [ ] User-configurable character/pattern stripping (e.g., Wikipedia citation marks [1], [2])
- [ ] Dark mode support
- [ ] Default voice selection based on macOS system language (detect via `Locale.current` and pick matching voice)
